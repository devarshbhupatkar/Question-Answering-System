The project revolves around finding answers from manuals which are hundreds of pages long. Hence, they are to be stored in textual form by ignoring the images and tables. The users will have to input their questions in the form of text and the model will find adequate answers from the text.
The questions entered by the user will be compared with every sentence of the textual manual. Every page will be broken down into paragraphs which will further be converted to sentences and then the sentences with the highest sentence similarity will be passed onto the Albert model which will find the adequate answers among the sentences passed to the model.
